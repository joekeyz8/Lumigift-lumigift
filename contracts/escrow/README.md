# Lumigift Escrow Contract

[![Contract Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-≥85%25-brightgreen)](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Soroban smart contract that time-locks USDC for a recipient until a predetermined timestamp.

---

## Storage Model

All state is kept in **instance storage** (tied to the contract instance lifetime and
auto-extended on every invocation). Every key is written once during `initialize` and
is immutable except `Claimed`, which transitions `false → true` on a successful claim.

| `DataKey`    | Rust type | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sender`     | `Address` | Gift creator; authorized the initial token transfer                    |
| `Recipient`  | `Address` | Address authorized to call `claim` and receive funds                   |
| `Token`      | `Address` | USDC contract address (see network addresses below)                    |
| `Amount`     | `i128`    | Locked amount in stroops (≥ 10 000 000 = 1 USDC)                       |
| `UnlockTime` | `u64`     | Unix timestamp (seconds) after which `claim` is open                   |
| `Claimed`    | `bool`    | `false` until claim succeeds; set to `true` atomically before transfer |

### USDC Contract Addresses

| Network | Address                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet | `CCW67TSZV3SSS2HXMBQ5JFGCKJNXKZM7UQUWUZPUTHXSTZLEO7SJMI75` |

## Contract Interface

### `initialize(sender, recipient, token, amount, unlock_time) → Result<(), EscrowError>`

Stores escrow parameters and transfers `amount` stroops of `token` from `sender`
into the contract address.

**Preconditions:**

- Contract must not already be initialized (`AlreadyInitialized`)
- `amount >= MIN_AMOUNT` (10 000 000 stroops = 1 USDC) (`InvalidAmount`)
- `unlock_time > ledger.timestamp() + MIN_LOCK_DURATION` (`InvalidUnlockTime`)
- `sender` must authorize the call (token transfer requires sender auth)

**Emits event:** `("initialized",)` → `(sender, recipient, amount, unlock_time)`

---

Automatically extends the instance TTL to cover `unlock_time` plus a 30-day buffer.

### `claim() → Result<(), EscrowError>`

Transfers the locked funds to `recipient`.

**Preconditions:**

- Contract must be initialized (`NotInitialized`)
- Caller must be `recipient` (enforced via `require_auth`)
- `ledger.timestamp() >= unlock_time` (`StillLocked`)
- Funds must not already be claimed (`AlreadyClaimed`)

**Atomicity:** `Claimed` is set to `true` _before_ the token transfer to prevent
re-entrancy and double-claim attacks.

**Emits event:** `("claimed",)` → `(recipient, amount)`

---

Extends the instance TTL to a 7-day post-claim window so the claimed state remains readable for reconciliation.

### `extend_ttl() → Result<(), EscrowError>`

Permissionless keeper function — anyone can call this to bump the instance TTL before it expires. Returns `NotInitialized` if the contract has not been set up.

### `get_state() → Result<(Address, i128, u64, bool), EscrowError>`

Returns `(recipient, amount, unlock_time, claimed)`.

Fails with `NotInitialized` if `initialize` has not been called.

## Building & Testing

```bash
# Build WASM
npm run contract:build          # from repo root

# Run all contract tests
cd contracts && cargo test

# Run only double-claim tests
cd contracts && cargo test double_claim
