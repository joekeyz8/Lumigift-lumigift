              <p>
                Lumigift is a platform for sending time-locked cash gifts. When you create a gift,
                the money is held in a smart contract on the Stellar blockchain until a specific
                unlock date that you choose.
              </p>
              <p>
                The recipient receives an SMS notification that a gift is waiting for them, but the
                amount remains completely hidden until the unlock date arrives. This creates a true
                surprise element for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries.

            <div>
              <p>Here's the complete gift lifecycle:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Payment:</strong> You pay in Nigerian Naira via Paystack, and the amount
                  is converted to USDC
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Escrow:</strong> The USDC is locked in a smart contract on the Stellar
                  blockchain
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Notification:</strong> The recipient gets an SMS saying a gift is waiting
                  (amount hidden)
                </li>
                <li>

        {
          id: "usdc-denomination",
          question: "Why are gifts denominated in USDC?",
          answer:
            "Gifts are converted to USDC (a US Dollar stablecoin) to ensure the value doesn't change between when you send the gift and when the recipient claims it. This protects against currency fluctuations and ensures your ₦5,000 gift maintains its dollar value over time.",
        },
        {
          id: "gift-expiry",
          question: "What happens if a gift isn't claimed?",
          answer:
            "If a gift remains unclaimed for 365 days after the unlock date, it automatically expires and the USDC is refunded to your original payment method. You'll receive an SMS notification when this happens.",

            <div>
              <p>
                Yes! When creating a gift, you can optionally set a "delivery date" that's separate
                from the unlock date. This lets you:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create the gift weeks in advance</li>
                <li>Have it delivered to the recipient on a specific date</li>
                <li>Set the unlock date for later (like their actual birthday)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The delivery date must be before or equal to the unlock date to give recipients time
                to receive and claim their gifts.

              <p>We support two payment providers:</p>
              <ul>

                  <strong>Paystack:</strong> For Nigerian users paying in Naira (₦) via bank

                <li>

          answer:
            "When you pay in Nigerian Naira, we convert your payment to USDC using the live exchange rate at the time of gift creation. This rate is fetched from the Stellar network and cached for 60 seconds to ensure accuracy. The USDC amount is locked in the smart contract, protecting against future currency fluctuations.",

              <p>Yes, there are several limits in place for security:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Minimum gift:</strong> ₦500 per gift

                <li>
                  <strong>Maximum gift:</strong> ₦500,000 per gift
                </li>
                <li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                These limits help protect against fraud and ensure the platform remains accessible
