## Prohibited Licenses

The following licenses are **incompatible** with this project and must never be introduced as production dependencies:

| License  | Reason                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| GPL-2.0  | Strong copyleft — requires source disclosure           |
| GPL-3.0  | Strong copyleft — requires source disclosure           |
| AGPL-3.0 | Network copyleft — requires source disclosure for SaaS |
| LGPL-2.0 | Weak copyleft — incompatible without dynamic linking   |
| LGPL-2.1 | Weak copyleft — incompatible without dynamic linking   |
| LGPL-3.0 | Weak copyleft — incompatible without dynamic linking   |

## Enforcement

- **npm**: `npm run license:check` uses `license-checker` to scan production dependencies and fails on any prohibited license.
- **Rust**: `cargo license --deny-licenses` in the `license-check` CI job scans Cargo dependencies.
- Both checks run on every PR and on the weekly scheduled CI scan.

## Adding a New Dependency

Before adding a dependency, verify its license is in the Allowed list above. If a dependency uses a license not listed here, open a discussion before merging.
