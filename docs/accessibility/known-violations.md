| Component     | `src/components/gift/GiftCard.tsx`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Description   | `ClaimButton` (renders a `<button>`) is a child of `<article role="button">`, creating nested interactive elements. Screen readers may not announce the inner button correctly, and keyboard focus order can be confusing.                                                                                     |
| Justification | Pre-existing structural issue in the GiftCard component. The outer `role="button"` navigates to the gift detail page; the inner `ClaimButton` triggers the claim flow. These two interactions need to be separated (e.g. remove `role="button"` from the article and use a dedicated navigation link instead). |

| Fix tracked   | Refactor GiftCard to use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of `role="button"` on the article element.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
