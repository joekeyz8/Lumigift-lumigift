# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Lumigift. ADRs document significant technical choices, the context that drove them, and the trade-offs accepted.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that captures a single architectural decision. It answers:

- **Why** was this decision made?
- **What** was decided?
- **What** are the consequences?
- **What** alternatives were considered?

## Creating a new ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to a new file: `NNNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded 4-digit number).
2. Fill in all sections.
3. Set the status to `Proposed` and open a PR for review.
4. Once merged, update the status to `Accepted`.
5. Add a row to the index table below.
