# Soroban Smart Contract Audit Plan

## Overview

The Lumigift escrow contract (`contracts/escrow`) locks USDC on behalf of users until a predetermined unlock time. Before mainnet deployment, an independent security audit is required.

---

## Audit Scope

### Contract: `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`

| Function     | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialize` | Deploys escrow state, transfers USDC from sender into contract |
| `claim`      | Releases funds to recipient after unlock time                  |
| `get_state`  | Read-only view of escrow state                                 |

### Areas of Focus

- **Token validation** — ensure only the canonical USDC contract address is accepted
- **Re-initialization guard** — verify the `already initialized` check is sufficient
- **Authorization** — `sender.require_auth()` and `recipient.require_auth()` correctness
- **Time-lock logic** — ledger timestamp comparison for unlock enforcement
- **Integer arithmetic** — amount handling in stroops (no overflow/underflow)
- **Storage hygiene** — correct use of `instance` storage and key namespacing
- **Event emissions** — accuracy of emitted event data

## Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                      | Severity | Mitigation                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fake token address passed to `initialize` | Critical | Validate `token == USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `initialize` (see issue #51)         |
| Re-initialization attack                  | High     | `already initialized` panic guard on `DataKey::Sender` presence                   |
| Premature claim                           | High     | `unlock_time` check against `env.ledger().timestamp()`                            |
| Unauthorized claim                        | High     | `recipient.require_auth()` enforced by Soroban host                               |
| Contract upgrade path                     | Medium   | No upgrade mechanism — contract is immutable; document this explicitly            |
| Ledger timestamp manipulation             | Low      | Soroban ledger timestamps are consensus-driven; not manipulable by a single party |
| Integer overflow on amount                | Low      | Soroban uses `i128`; amounts in stroops are well within range                     |

## Audit Timeline

| Milestone                             | Target Date                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Finalize contract code & freeze scope | 2 weeks before audit start |
| Firm selection & NDA signed           | 4 weeks before mainnet     |
| Audit engagement begins               | 6 weeks before mainnet     |
| Preliminary findings delivered        | 8 weeks before mainnet     |
| Fixes implemented & re-review         | 10 weeks before mainnet    |
| Final audit report published          | 2 weeks before mainnet     |
| Mainnet deployment                    | TBD                        |

## Bug Bounty Program

A bug bounty program is recommended to complement the formal audit and provide ongoing security coverage post-launch.

### Proposed Scope

- **In scope:** `contracts/escrow` on testnet and mainnet
- **Out of scope:** Frontend UI, off-chain services, third-party integrations (Paystack, Stripe)

### Severity & Rewards

| Severity | Example                               | Reward                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Critical | Drain escrow funds, bypass time-lock  | $5,000 – $20,000 USDC |
| High     | Unauthorized claim, re-initialization | $1,000 – $5,000 USDC  |
| Medium   | Incorrect event data, DoS             | $250 – $1,000 USDC    |
| Low      | Gas inefficiency, informational       | $50 – $250 USDC       |

### Recommended Platforms

- [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com) — largest Web3 bug bounty platform
- [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com) — broad security community

> Launch the bug bounty program at the same time as mainnet deployment. Fund the bounty pool before going live.
