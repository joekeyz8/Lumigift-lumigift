# Stellar Server Key Rotation Procedure

**Applies to:** `STELLAR_SERVER_SECRET_KEY` — the server-side Stellar signing key used to authorize all escrow transactions.

## Overview

The server signing key is a long-lived secret. If it is compromised, an attacker could sign unauthorized USDC transfers from the escrow account. This document describes how to rotate the key safely with zero downtime and a full audit trail.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the production secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Vercel environment variables).
- Stellar CLI or the Stellar Laboratory to generate a new keypair.
- Access to the Stellar escrow account to update signers.
- On-call engineer available during the rotation window.

## Key Storage Requirements

In production the key **must** be stored in a secrets manager, not only in environment variables:

| Environment | Storage                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local dev   | `.env.local` (never committed)                                         |
| Staging     | Vercel environment variables (encrypted at rest)                       |
| Production  | AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault; injected as env var at runtime |

Never store the raw secret key in source code, CI logs, or unencrypted config files.

## Rotation Procedure

### Step 1 — Generate a New Keypair

```bash
# Using Stellar CLI
stellar keys generate new-server-key --network mainnet

# Or using the Stellar SDK (Node.js)
node -e "
const { Keypair } = require('@stellar/stellar-sdk');
const kp = Keypair.random();
console.log('Public:', kp.publicKey());
console.log('Secret:', kp.secret());
"
```

Record the new public key (`G…`) and secret key (`S…`). Store the secret immediately in your secrets manager — do not leave it in terminal history.

### Step 2 — Fund the New Account (if needed)

The new key must correspond to a funded Stellar account before it can sign transactions.

```bash
# Testnet only — use Friendbot
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<NEW_PUBLIC_KEY>"

# Mainnet — transfer minimum XLM reserve from existing account
```

### Step 3 — Add the New Key as a Signer on the Escrow Account

While the old key is still active, add the new key as an additional signer with the same weight. This allows both keys to sign during the transition window.

```bash
stellar tx new set-options \
  --source-account <ESCROW_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --signer-key <NEW_PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --signer-weight 1 \
  --network mainnet \
  --sign-with-key <OLD_SECRET_KEY>
```

### Step 4 — Update the Secret in the Secrets Manager

Update `STELLAR_SERVER_SECRET_KEY` to the new secret key value in your secrets manager. Do **not** remove the old key yet.

```bash
# AWS Secrets Manager example
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
  --secret-id lumigift/production/stellar-server-secret-key \
  --secret-string '{"STELLAR_SERVER_SECRET_KEY":"<NEW_SECRET_KEY>"}'
```

### Step 5 — Deploy and Verify

1. Trigger a new deployment so the application picks up the new key.
2. Verify the app is signing transactions with the new key:
   - Check `/api/health?deep=1` returns `200 ok`.
   - Perform a test transaction on staging before production.
   - Monitor application logs for signing errors.

### Step 6 — Remove the Old Key as a Signer

Once the new deployment is confirmed healthy (allow at least 15 minutes), remove the old key from the escrow account's signer list.

```bash
stellar tx new set-options \
  --source-account <ESCROW_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --signer-key <OLD_PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --signer-weight 0 \
  --network mainnet \
  --sign-with-key <NEW_SECRET_KEY>
```

Setting signer weight to `0` removes the signer.

### Step 7 — Record the Audit Log Entry

After successful rotation, record the event in the audit log (see below). This is required for compliance.

### Step 8 — Revoke the Old Key

Securely delete the old secret key from all locations:

- Remove from secrets manager (or mark as deprecated/inactive).
- Clear from any local `.env` files.
- Rotate any backups that contained the old key.

## Zero-Downtime Guarantee

The procedure above ensures zero downtime because:

1. The new key is added as a co-signer **before** the old key is removed.
2. The application is redeployed with the new key while both keys are valid.
3. The old key is only removed after the new deployment is confirmed healthy.

## Effect on Existing Transactions

Transactions already submitted to the Stellar network are immutable — they are not affected by key rotation. Only future transactions require the new key.

## Audit Log

Every key rotation must be recorded. Append an entry to `docs/ops/key-rotation-log.md`:

```markdown
## Rotation — YYYY-MM-DD

- Rotated by: [engineer name]
- Reason: [scheduled / suspected compromise / other]
- Old public key: G…
- New public key: G…
- Deployment: [deployment ID or commit SHA]
- Verified healthy: [yes/no]
- Old key removed from signers: [yes/no, timestamp]
```

The application also emits a structured log entry at rotation time (see `src/lib/stellar.ts` audit log hook).

## Emergency Rotation (Key Compromise)

If the key is suspected to be compromised, follow the same steps but with urgency:

1. **Immediately** add the new key as a co-signer (Step 3).
2. **Immediately** remove the old key as a signer (Step 6) — do not wait for a full deployment cycle.
3. Deploy the new key to production as fast as possible.
4. Investigate the compromise: check access logs, rotate all related secrets.
5. Notify the security team and file an incident report.
